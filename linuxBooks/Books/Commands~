$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git

$ git pull

If your tarball is compressed with bzip2, run
$ tar xvjf linux-x.y.z.tar.bz2
If it is compressed with GNU zip, run
$ tar xvzf linux-x.y.z.tar.gz

$ make menuconfig

$ make gconfig

This command creates a configuration based on the defaults for your architecture:
$ make defconfig


After making changes to your configuration file, or when using an existing con-
figuration file on a new kernel tree, you can validate and update the configuration:
$ make oldconfig
You should always run this before building a kernel.

After the kernel configuration is set—however you do it—you can build it with a sin-
gle command:
$ make

$ make -jn

$ make > ../detritus

$ make > /dev/null


Installing modules, thankfully, is automated and architecture-independent. As root,
simply run
% make modules_install
